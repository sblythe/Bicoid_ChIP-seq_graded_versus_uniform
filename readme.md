This repository contains BigWig formatted coverage data for *Drosophila* ChIP-seq against EGFP-tagged Bicoid protein in blastoderm stage embryos.
For this experiment, Bicoid occupancy was measured under four conditions.

1) Graded, wild-type EGFP-Bcd
2) Uniform, high EGFP-Bcd
3) Uniform, medium EGFP-Bcd
4) Uniform, low EGFP-Bcd

The different expression levels were achieved by driving non-localized (uniform) *bcd* mRNA expression with different maternal promoters.
High expression was driven with the *alpha-Tubulin 67C* promoter, medium with the *matrimony* promoter, and low expression with the *bicoid* promoter.

These data are associated with a prior publication: [Hannon, Blythe, & Wieschaus, eLife 2017](https://elifesciences.org/articles/28275), but have been re-mapped to the *dm6* version of the genome.
Replicates were merged and average coverage over 10 bp windows was calculated. Data are CPM normalized. Raw data is available through GEO/SRA at accession number [GSE86966](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE86966).

The "UCSC_display_links..." file is used for display of the bigwig files on the UCSC genome browser.
